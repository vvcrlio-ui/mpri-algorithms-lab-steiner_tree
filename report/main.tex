\subsection{Problem Definition: Minimum Steiner Tree}
\label{sec:problem_definition_en}

The following is the standard formal definition of the Minimum Steiner Tree problem, as found in the compendium.

\begin{description}
    \item[Instance:] 
    A complete graph $G=(V,E)$, a metric given by edge weights $w: E \to \mathbb{Z}^+$, and a subset of required vertices $S \subset V$.

    \item[Solution:] 
    A Steiner tree, i.e., a subtree of $G$ that includes all the vertices in $S$.

    \item[Measure:] 
    The sum of the weights of the edges in the subtree, which is to be minimized.

    \item[Good News:] 
    The problem is approximable within a ratio of $1+\ln(3)/2 \approx 1.55$. In your project file, this approximation ratio is simplified to 2.

    \item[Bad News:] 
    The problem is APX-complete.
    
    \item[Garey and Johnson:] ND12.

\subsection{NP-completeness Proof}
\label{sec:np_completeness_proof}

We show that the decision version of the Minimum Steiner Tree problem is NP-complete.

\paragraph{1. Membership in NP.}
Given a subgraph $T'$, we can verify in polynomial time that it is connected, acyclic, contains all required vertices $R$, and that its total weight $\sum_{e \in T'} w(e) \le K$. Hence, the problem is in NP.

\paragraph{2. NP-hardness via reduction from X3C.}
We reduce from the \emph{Exact Cover by 3-Sets} (X3C) problem, which is NP-complete.

\textbf{X3C instance:} a set $X$ with $|X|=3q$ and a collection $C=\{C_1,\dots,C_n\}$ of 3-element subsets of $X$.  
\textbf{Question:} does there exist $C'\subseteq C$ such that every element of $X$ appears in exactly one member of $C'$?

\textbf{Construction of Steiner Tree instance:}
\[
V=\{v_0\}\cup\{v_{C_i}\mid C_i\in C\}\cup\{v_{x_j}\mid x_j\in X\},
\]
with edges and weights:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $(v_0,v_{C_i})$ with weight $1$ for each $C_i\in C$;
  \item $(v_{C_i},v_{x_j})$ with weight $1$ for each $x_j\in C_i$.
\end{itemize}
Terminals: $R=\{v_0\}\cup\{v_{x_1},\dots,v_{x_{3q}}\}$, and budget $K=4q$.

\textbf{Equivalence:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item[$(\Rightarrow)$] If X3C has an exact cover $C'$, then taking all edges 
  $(v_0,v_{C_i})$ and $(v_{C_i},v_{x_j})$ for $C_i\in C'$ yields a tree of total weight $q+3q=4q$, satisfying the Steiner constraint.
  \item[$(\Leftarrow)$] Conversely, if there exists a Steiner tree of weight $\le 4q$, it must contain exactly $3q$ edges connecting element vertices and $q$ edges connecting the corresponding $v_{C_i}$ to $v_0$. These $q$ sets are disjoint and cover $X$, forming an exact cover.
\end{itemize}

Thus, the reduction holds in polynomial time, and the Minimum Steiner Tree problem is NP-complete.
